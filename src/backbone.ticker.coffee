# Backbone.Ticker.js
#
# A simple, drop-in Backbone.js ticker that runs a given payload at a specified interval. Useful for
# implementing a solid long-poller; it comes with start, stop, pause and resume built in, as well
# as a handy `nudge` function, to run the payload immediately before resuming again.
